# Parser Review Specification

This is planning phase. Do not code. 

- [ ] Scan `builder.rs` and `parser.rs` for all `@Todo` comments.
- [ ] Investigate those comments as a whole to identify any common themes and required refactoring. Find out if proposed
  refactoring is feasible and beneficial.
- [ ] Maybe we need to clarify proposals and better align them with project priorities: first priority WASM size, second
  priority performance, third priority code maintainability.
- [ ] Write a summary of findings and proposed actions in this PARSER_REVIEW_SPEC.md.
