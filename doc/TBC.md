## Literal Duration Support (TBC, subject to change)

You can also create durations using a literal syntax:

```edgerules
1 years 6 months    // 1 year 6 months (years–months)
6 months            // 6 months (years–months)
45 minutes          // 45 minutes (days–time)
2 days 3 hours      // 2 days 3 hours (days–time)
-1 years            // negative 1 year (allowed)
```

## Todo

- Literal support for durations (years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds)
- More date/time functions (e.g., adding support for week of year, quarter of year, etc.)
